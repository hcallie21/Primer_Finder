# Primer_Finder
Objective: This script's goal is to find suitable primer sequences for PCR for a given gene 

Requires gff3, fasta file, and gene name for input

Searches for gene, takes upstream and downstream sequences, then evaluates different frames both forward and reverse for primers based on melting temperature, self compatibility, dimers, repeats, etc.
